      <h2>How Attendosync Works</h2>
      <p>Attendosync is a smart attendance management machine that uses a combination of biometric scanning, RFID cards, and cloud storage to record, store, and analyze attendance data in real time. The system integrates with company databases and HR management tools to generate accurate reports and ensure compliance with work policies. It also allows employees to view their attendance records and request leave directly through the platform.</p>
